# Contributing

Check out the [Contributing Guide](https://guides.rostools.org/contributing) for
more details on how to contribute. For guidelines on how to be a helper or
teacher, check out the [For teachers](https://guides.rostools.org/instructors)
page. As always, make sure to adhere to the [Code of
Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## :bug: Issues and bugs

The easiest way to contribute is to report issues or bugs that you might find
while using or reading the workshop material. You can do this by creating a new
issue on our GitHub repository.

## :pencil2: Adding or modifying content

To contribute to the workshop, you first need to install
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and
[justfile](https://just.systems/man/en/packages.html). We use uv and justfile to
manage our project, such as to run checks and build the workshop website. Both
the uv and justfile websites have a more detailed guide on using uv, but below
are some simple instructions to get you started.

It's easiest to [install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) first and then install
justfile using uv. Then, to install justfile, run:

```bash
uv tool install rust-just
```

We keep all our development workflows in the `justfile`, so you can explore it
to see what commands are available. To see a list of commands available, run:

```bash
just
```

As you contribute, make sure your changes will pass our checks by opening a
terminal so that the working directory is the root of this workshop's
parent/root folder and running:

```bash
just run-all
```

When committing changes, please try to follow [Conventional
Commits](https://decisions.seedcase-project.org/why-conventional-commits/) as
Git messages. Using this convention allows us to be able to automatically create
a release based on the commit message by using
[Cocogitto](https://decisions.seedcase-project.org/why-semantic-release-with-cocogitto/).
If you don't use Conventional Commits when making a commit, we will revise the
pull request title to follow that format. That's because we use squash merges
when merging pull requests, so all other commits in the pull request will be
squashed into one commit.

## :file_folder: Support and infrastructure files

- `.copier-answers.yml`: Contains the answers you gave when copying the project
  from the template. **You should not modify this file directly.**
- `.gitignore`: This ignore file tells Git which files to not track. Unless you
  know what you are doing, it's best to not touch this file.
- `_quarto.yml`: Quarto configuration file for the website, including settings
  for the website, such as the theme, navigation, and other options.
- `_metadata.yml`: Quarto metadata file for the website, including information
  about the project, such as the titles and GitHub names.
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) configuration
  file for managing and running checks before each commit.
- `.config/`: Contains configuration files for various tools used in the
  project, such as:

    [Panache](https://panache.bz) configuration file for formatting Markdown
    files in the project.
- `.zenodo.json`: Structured citation metadata for your project when archived on
  [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/). This is used to add the metadata to Zenodo when
  a GitHub release has been uploaded to Zenodo.
- `justfile`: [`just`](https://just.systems/man/en/) configuration file for
  scripting project tasks.
- `.editorconfig`: Editor configuration file for
  [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) to maintain consistent coding styles
  across different editors and IDEs.
